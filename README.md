other components incude a 3G sim of your choice, a power bank (we used a T-CORE USB C Portable Charger with a Wireless Charging USB C adapter ), some LEDS and a 3Dprinted case with the file attached, GSM antenna, and wires of course

The goal of this project was to create an open source alternative to Life alert, the build should be portless and can be programed wirelessly with the bluetooth modual and charged wirelessly.

This is a prototype build and is not perfect.
